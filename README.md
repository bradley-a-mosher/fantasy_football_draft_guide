# Fantasy Football Draft Guide

This project is designed to consolidate all fantasy football research into one place. I created this tool because I was tired of bouncing between multiple websites when preparing for drafts or making in-draft decisions. With this app, you can research player stats, coaching impacts, and fantasy trends â€” all in one spot.

## Features

- **Team Overview:** Year-over-year offensive stats with coaching context (HC/OC changes, interim roles).
- **Coach Overview:** Analyze performance of head coaches and offensive coordinators across passing, rushing, receiving, and fantasy metrics.
- **Player Overview (Coming Soon):** Deep dive into individual player performance and trends.
- **Fantasy Insights:** View league-wide fantasy points and rankings (standard & PPR) with filters for positions and usage.

## Live Demo
